I am one of the founders of [banva.io](https://banva.io). Banva is a browser based subtitling product which allows users to generate automated subtitles in 50+ languages, edit generated subtitles, style them, and download them.

Previously, I did research and engineering work in speech and audio processing at Georgia Tech and Motorola Solution. I like machine learning and software engineering.
