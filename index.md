I am one of the founders of [banva.io](https://banva.io). Banva is a browser based subtitling product which allows users to generate automated subtitles in 50+ languages, edit generated subtitles, style them, and download them. My technical interests are in machine learning and software engineering. Currently, I am mostly obsessed in building software which enhances human creation. 

Previously, I did research and engineering work in speech and audio processing at Georgia Tech and Motorola Solution.
